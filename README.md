# 2048
Technologies used: C language, Ncurses framework

CLI version for the game 2048 designed and implemented by me. The game is designed and can only be run on GNU/Linux.
The game contains a menu with 3 options and a game screen. It is made to be understood easily using colors. The score and current time can also be checked in the game screen.

### Installation

Requirements : libncurses-dev
```
git clone https://github.com/mehai/2048.git
make 
make run
```
### Fun facts
This was my first EVER programming project. I am aware that the coding style and the implementation is not that good.
The language that you can find in some of the game instructions and in the code comments is Romanian (sorry for that).
The game has a simplistic AI : if you do not make a move for 2 seconds, the game will make the move for you so that the most squares will be freed.
